# ResNet-vs-PlainCNN
ResNet vs Plain CNN: This repository contains code and experiments to compare the performance of ResNet50 and a plain CNN (a similar network without skip connections) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Both models are trained from scratch to provide a fair and insightful analysis of how residual connections impact training and performance.
